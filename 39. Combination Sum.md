# 39. Combination Sum
## Description:
Given a set of candidate numbers (candidates) (without duplicates) and a target number (target), find all unique combinations in candidates where the candidate numbers sums to target.

The same repeated number may be chosen from candidates unlimited number of times.

Note:

All numbers (including target) will be positive integers.
The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.

Example:
```
Input: candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7,
A solution set is:
[
  [7],
  [2,2,3]
]
```

## Solution:
### Python:
```
class Solution:
    def combinationSum(self, candidates: List[int], target: int) -> List[List[int]]:

        candidates.sort()
        mini = candidates[0]
        result = []

        def combination_find(target, start, end, path):

            if target == 0:
            # path sum equals to target, find one valid combination
                result.append(path)
			    return

            for i in range(start, end + 1):
                cur = candidates[i]
                
                if cur > target:
                    break

                remaining = target - cur

                if remaining and remaining < mini: 
                    # remainder is smaller than smallest number in candidates
                    continue

                combination_find(remaining, i, end, path + [cur])

        combination_find(target, 0, len(candidates) - 1, [])
        return result
```
