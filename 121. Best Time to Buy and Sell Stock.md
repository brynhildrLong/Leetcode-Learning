# 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
## Description:
Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.

Example:
```
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
             Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.
             
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

## Idea:
  Finding the ```minprice``` and then find the ```maxprofit``` after i th element.
  
## Solution -- One Pass
### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        length = len(prices)
        if length == 0:
            return 0
        minprice = prices[0]
        maxprofit = 0
        
        for i in range(length):
            if prices[i] < minprice:
                minprice = prices[i]
            if prices[i] - minprice > maxprofit:
                maxprofit = prices[i] - minprice
        return maxprofit
```

# 122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II
## Description:
Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

## Solution -- One pass:

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        maxprofit = 0
        if len(prices) == 0:
            return 0
        if len(prices) == 1:
            return 0
        for i in range (1,len(prices)):
            if prices[i-1] < prices[i]:
                temp = prices[i] - prices[i-1]
                maxprofit += temp
                
        return maxprofit
```

## Solution -- Two value:

We can not skip any peak because from the image above, ```C``` is less than ```A+B```

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        if len(prices) == 0 or len(prices) == 1:
            return 0
        peak = 0
        valley = prices[0]
        i, maxprofit = 0, 0
        while i < len(prices)-1:
            while i < len(prices)-1 and prices[i] >= prices[i+1]:
                i += 1
            valley = prices[i]
            while i < len(prices)-1 and prices[i] < prices[i+1]:
                i += 1
            peak = prices[i]
            
            maxprofit += peak - valley
            
        return maxprofit
```
