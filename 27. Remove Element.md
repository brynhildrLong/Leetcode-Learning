# 27. Remove Element
## Description:
Given an array nums and a value val, remove all instances of that value in-place and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

The order of elements can be changed. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.

### Example:
```
Given nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3,

Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.

It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
```

## Solution -- Two Pointers:
When nums[j] equals to the given value, skip this element by incrementing j. As long as nums[j] =val, we copy nums[j] to nums[i] and increment both indexes at the same time. Repeat the process until j reaches the end of the array and the new length is i.


### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def removeElement(self, nums: List[int], val: int) -> int:
        i = 0
        for j in range (len(nums)):
            if (nums[j] != val):
                nums[i] = nums[j]
                i += 1
        return i
```

### Approach 2: Two Pointers - when elements to remove are rare
move the elements from rare.
```python
class Solution:
    def removeElement(self, nums: List[int], val: int) -> int:
        l = len(nums)
        i = 0
        while i < l:
            if nums[i] == val:
                nums [i] = nums[l-1]
                l -= 1
            else:
                i += 1
        return l
```
