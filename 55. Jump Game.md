# 55. Jump Game
## Description:
Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.

Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Determine if you are able to reach the last index.

Example:
```
Input: [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: true
Explanation: Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.

Input: [3,2,1,0,4]
Output: false
Explanation: You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its maximum
             jump length is 0, which makes it impossible to reach the last index.
```

## Solution 1 -- Greedy Algorithm

  A greedy algorithm is any algorithm that follows the problem-solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at each stage[1] with the intent of finding a global optimum.
  
  First, be sure to iterate through all the elements, not jump. The second attention to the update method of maxreach is the larger of the maximum value that can be reached in the previous cycle, and the maximum value that can be reached currently, i + nums [i].
  
  ```python
  class Solution:
    def canJump(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        length = len(nums)
        maxReach = 0
        i = 0
        while i < length: 
            if i > maxReach:  
                return False
            maxReach = max(maxReach, i+nums[i])
            if maxReach >= length-1:
                return True
            i += 1
  ```

## Solution 2 -- Bottom up
  Look forward from the back of the list, and when you encounter 0, determine whether there is a position in front of this 0 that can jump to this 0 (you can't just jump to 0, because you die after jumping to 0)
  
  ```python
 class Solution:
    def canJump(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        if 0 not in nums: 
            return True
        if nums[-1] == 0: 
            nums[-1] = 1
        now_index = len(nums) - 1
        while now_index >= 0:
            if nums[now_index] != 0: now_index -= 1
            else:
                tem_index = now_index - 1
                while tem_index >= 0:
                    if nums[tem_index] > now_index - tem_index:
                        now_index = tem_index
                        break
                    else: tem_index -= 1
                if tem_index == -1: return False
                else: now_index -= 1
        return True
  ```
