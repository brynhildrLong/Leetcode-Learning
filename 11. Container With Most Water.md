# 11. Container With Most Water
## Description:
Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Note: You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.

Example:
```
Input: [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
```

## Solution:
Solution 1-- Brute Froce:
  Using 2 ```for``` loop to iterate through the list. ```i``` and ```j``` are the indexes to represent the head and tail of the rectangle respectively.
  
### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        maxWater = 0
        length = 0
        width = 0
        for i in range (len(height)):
            for j in range (i+1, len(height)):
                length = j - i
                width = min(height[i], height[j])
                maxWater = max(maxWater, length * width)
        return maxWater
```


Solution 2-- Two Pointer
  Using 1 ```while``` loop to interate through the list.

### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        maxWater = 0
        head = 0
        tail = len(height)-1
        while head < tail:
            length = min(height[head], height[tail])
            width =  tail - head
            maxWater =  max(maxWater, length*width)
            if height[head] < height[tail]:
                head += 1
            else:
                tail -= 1
        return maxWater
```
