Two Sum
##Description:
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.



Solution:
python 3:

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        h = {}
        for index, element in enumerate(nums):
            number = target - element
            if number not in h:
                h[element] = index
            else:
                return [h[number], index]
```
