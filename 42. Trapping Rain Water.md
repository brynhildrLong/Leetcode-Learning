# 42. Trapping Rain Water
## Description:
Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it is able to trap after raining.

Example:
```
Input: [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
```

## Solution -- DP:
  Using two lists to save the max height from left to right and from right to left. Save the max value at ith location

  ```python
  class Solution:
    def trap(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        length = len(height)
        if length == 0:
            return 0
        left = [0] * length
        rigth = [0] * length
        left[0] = height[0]
        rain = 0
        rigth[length-1] = height[-1]
        for i in range(1, length):
            left[i] = max(left[i-1],height[i])
        for j in range(length-2, 0, -1):
            rigth[j] = max(rigth[j+1],height[j])
        for i in range(1,length):
            rain += min(left[i], rigth[i]) - height[i]
        return rain
  ```

## Solution -- Two point
  Let's look at a solution that only needs to be traversed once. This algorithm requires the left and right pointers to point to the beginning and end of the array, and scan from both sides to the middle. Within the range determined by the current two pointers, first compare the two ends to find the comparison. Small value, if the smaller value is the value pointed by left, then scan from left to right, if the smaller value is the value pointed by right, then scan from right to left, if the value encountered is smaller than when the smaller value, then The difference is stored in the result. 
  If the value encountered is large, the new window range is determined again, and so on until the left and right pointers coincide. 

```python
class Solution:
    def trap(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        length = len(height)
        left = 0
        right = length-1
        leftMax, rightMax = 0, 0
        rain = 0
        while left < right:
            if height[left] < height[right]:
                if leftMax < height[left]:
                    leftMax = height[left]
                else:
                    rain += leftMax - height[left]
                left += 1
            else:
                if rightMax < height[right]:
                    rightMax = height[right]
                else:
                    rain += rightMax - height[right]
                right -= 1
        return rain
```
