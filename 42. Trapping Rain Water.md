Example:
```
Input: [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
```

## Solution -- DP:
  Using two lists to save the max height from left to right and from right to left. Save the max value at ith location

  ```python
  class Solution:
    def trap(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        length = len(height)
        if length == 0:
            return 0
        left = [0] * length
        rigth = [0] * length
        left[0] = height[0]
        rain = 0
        rigth[length-1] = height[-1]
        for i in range(1, length):
            left[i] = max(left[i-1],height[i])
        for j in range(length-2, 0, -1):
            rigth[j] = max(rigth[j+1],height[j])
        for i in range(1,length):
            rain += min(left[i], rigth[i]) - height[i]
        return rain
  ```
