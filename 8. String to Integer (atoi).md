# 8. String to Integer (atoi)
## Descrption:
Implement atoi which converts a string to an integer.

The function first discards as many whitespace characters as necessary until the first non-whitespace character is found. Then, starting from this character, takes an optional initial plus or minus sign followed by as many numerical digits as possible, and interprets them as a numerical value.

The string can contain additional characters after those that form the integral number, which are ignored and have no effect on the behavior of this function.

If the first sequence of non-whitespace characters in str is not a valid integral number, or if no such sequence exists because either str is empty or it contains only whitespace characters, no conversion is performed.

If no valid conversion could be performed, a zero value is returned.

Note:

Only the space character ' ' is considered as whitespace character.
Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−2^31,  2^31 − 1]. If the numerical value is out of the range of representable values, INT_MAX (231 − 1) or INT_MIN (−231) is returned.

### Example:
```
Input: "42"
Output: 42
```

## Solution:
### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def myAtoi(self, s: str) -> int:
        flag = 0
        negative = False
        output = ""
        while flag < len(s): 
            if s[flag] == " ":
                flag += 1
            elif s[flag] == "-":
                negative = True
                #output += s[flag]
                flag += 1
            elif s[flag] == "0" or "1" or "2" or "3" or "4" or "5" or "6" or "7" or "8" or "9":
                output += s[flag]
                flag +=1
            else:
                break
        num = int(output)
        if num > 2147483647 or num < -2147483647:
            return 2147483647
        else:
            if negative:
                num = -1*num
                return num
            else:
                return int(output)
```

There is also another solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def myAtoi(self, str: str) -> int:
        import re
        m = re.search('^\s*[\-\+]?\d+', str)
        if m:
            m = int(m.group(0))
            low = -pow(2, 31)
            high = pow(2, 31) - 1
            if m = high:
                return high
            else:
                return m
        else:
            return 0
```

## Idea:
Definition: re.search looks for the first substring in a given string that matches the given regular expression.
```m``` receives the result of a regex regular expression on the content string to implement the search function
If m is not empty, use m.group (index) to output the found substring

```[]``` Brackets match any character in the set;-range of matching characters

```\s``` space means space

```^``` Match start position

```+``` Means match at least once

```*``` Means match at least 0 times

```\d``` means match a number

```'^\s*[\-\+]?\d+'``` Means at the beginning, the string must have 0 time space and then at least 1 time digit.
