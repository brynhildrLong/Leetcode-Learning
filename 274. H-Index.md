# 274. H-Index
## Description:
Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

Example:
```
Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
Output: 3 
Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had 
             received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. 
             Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining 
             two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.
```

## Idea:
  Using binary division. Find the ```min value``` of current list value and the elements number
  Get the ```max value``` of exist index and current index

## Solution -- Binary
### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def hIndex(self, citations: List[int]) -> int:
        citations.sort()
        l = len(citations)
        head = 0
        tail = l-1
        index = 0
        while head <= tail:
            mid = (head+tail)//2
            index = max(index, min(citations[mid], l-mid))
            if citations[mid] < l-mid:
                head = mid + 1
            else:
                tail = mid - 1
        return index
```
