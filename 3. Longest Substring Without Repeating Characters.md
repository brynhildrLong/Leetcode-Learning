# 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
## Description:
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
#### Example:
```
Input: "abcabcbb"
Output: 3 
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. 

Input: "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

Input: "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3. 
             Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```

## Idea:
  Each time scan the string ```s```, it should determine the character had been in sub-string or not. If yes, the sub-string should be started from the next charater of this charater. If no, add this charater to sub-string
  
## Solution:
### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        maxLength = 0
        subString = ''
        for i in s:
            if i in subString:
                subString = subString[subString.index(i)+1:]
            subString += i
            maxLength = max (maxLength, len(subString))
            
        return maxLength
```

### Note:
  1. ```stringName.index(character)``` means find the index of **character** in **stringName**
  2. ```max()``` function can compare two number and output the larger one
