# 48. Rotate Image
## Discription:
You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image.

Rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

Note:

You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.

Example:
```
Given input matrix = 
[
  [1,2,3],
  [4,5,6],
  [7,8,9]
],

rotate the input matrix in-place such that it becomes:
[
  [7,4,1],
  [8,5,2],
  [9,6,3]
]
```

## Solution:
### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def rotate(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify matrix in-place instead.
        """
        n = len(matrix) - 1 # number of cells in a row/col
        l = 0 # current layer
        
        # rotate each layer l 
        while l < math.ceil(n/2):
            
            # iterate through the rows/cols at the current layer
            for i in range(l, n-l):
                
                temp = matrix[l][i]               # stores top row
                matrix[l][i] = matrix[n-i][l]     # assign left col to top row
                matrix[n-i][l] = matrix[n-l][n-i] # assign bottom row to left col
                matrix[n-l][n-i] = matrix[i][n-l] # assign right col to bottom row
                matrix[i][n-l] = temp             # assign top row to right col
            
            # increase layer
            l += 1
```
