# 33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array
## Description:
Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).

Example:
```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1
```

## Idea:
  Using ```binary search``` to solve this problem
  
  
## Solution:
### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        length = len(nums)
        head = 0
        tail = length-1
        
        while head <= tail:
            mid = (head+tail) // 2
            if nums[mid] == target:
                return mid
            elif nums[mid] < nums[tail]:
                if nums[mid+1] <= target <= nums[tail]:
                    head = mid + 1
                    continue
                else:
                    tail = mid - 1
                    continue
            else:
                if nums[head] <= target <= nums[mid-1]:
                    tail = mid - 1
                    continue
                else:
                    head = mid + 1
                    continue
        
        return -1
```
