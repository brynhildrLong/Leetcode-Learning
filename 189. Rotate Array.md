# 189. Rotate Array
## Description:
Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.

Example 1:
```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] and k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
```

## Solutuion -- brute force:
```python
class Solution:
    def rotate(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        temp = 0
        previous = 0
        for i in range(k):
            previous = nums[len(nums)-1]
            for j in range(len(nums)):
                temp = nums[j]
                nums[j] = previous
                previous = temp
```
