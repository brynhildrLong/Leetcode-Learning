# 6. ZigZag Conversion
## Description:
The string "PAYPALISHIRING" is written in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows like this: (you may want to display this pattern in a fixed font for better legibility)
```
P   A   H   N
A P L S I I G
Y   I   R
```
And then read line by line: ```"PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"```

## Idea:
This is a index problem, we should find the law of the index between string and two-dimensional list.
```
P   A   H   N
A P L S I I G
Y   I   R
```
The index in this two-dimensional list is--
```
0   4   8     12
1 3 5 7 9  11 13
2   6   10    
```
It's not hard to find:
  1. The first row and last row, 4-0=4, 8-4=4. The difference is 4, which is (numRows-1)*2
  2. The second row, the difference is 2, 2*No.x row
So we can find the next index according to current index.

## Solution
### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def convert(self, s: str, numRows: int) -> str:
        if numRows == 1:
            return s
        output = ""
        cur = 0
        for n in range(numRows):
            move = [(numRows-1)*2-2*n, 2*n]
            if n == 0:
                move[1]=(numRows-1)*2
            elif n == numRows-1:
                move[0] = 2*n
            
            i = n
            cnt = 0
            while i < len(s):
                output += s[i]
                cnt += 1
                i += move[cnt % 2]
        return output
```
