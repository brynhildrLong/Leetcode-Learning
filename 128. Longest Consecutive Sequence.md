# 128. Longest Consecutive Sequence
## Description:
Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.

## Solution -- Sorting:
  Firstly, sort the list
  Then, counting the consecutive sequence list. If ```nums[i] != nums[i-1]+1```, re-set variable ```length_current``` after compare.
  
  ```python
  class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums.sort()
        if len(nums) == 0:
            return 0
        
        length_current = 1
        length_max = 1
        for i in range(1,len(nums)):
            if nums[i-1] < nums[i]:
                if nums[i] == nums[i-1]+1:
                    length_current += 1
                else:
                    length_max = max(length_max, length_current)
                    length_current = 1
        return max(length_max, length_current)
  ```

## Solution -- Hash map:
  Firstly, remove the repeated elements in the list.
  
  Find the num which doesn't have num-1, this is the smallest number of this consecutive squence.
  
  start the counting
  
  ```python
  class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums):
        longest_streak = 0
        num_set = set(nums)

        for num in num_set:
            if num - 1 not in num_set:
                current_num = num
                current_streak = 1

                while current_num + 1 in num_set:
                    current_num += 1
                    current_streak += 1

                longest_streak = max(longest_streak, current_streak)

        return longest_streak
  ```
