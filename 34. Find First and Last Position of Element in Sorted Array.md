# 34. Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array
## Discription:
Given an array of integers nums sorted in ascending order, find the starting and ending position of a given target value.

Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).

If the target is not found in the array, return [-1, -1].

Example:
```
Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 8
Output: [3,4]

Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 6
Output: [-1,-1]
```

## Idea:
  Because the time complexity can only be O(log n), so we can use ```binary search```
  Recursive function that can find if the last and next number of```num[mid]``` are the same(target)
  Using a ```flag``` to determine that is the most left side index, if yes, make flag = False.
  Again, using function to find the last index
  
## Solution:
### Python:
Binary Search:
```python
class Solution:
    def binarySearch(self, nums, target,flag):
        head = 0
        tail = len(nums)
        while head < tail:
            mid = int((head+tail) / 2)
            if nums[mid] > target or (flag and target == nums[mid]):
                tail = mid 
            else:
                head = mid + 1
        
        return head
    def searchRange(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        
        
        head_idx = self.binarySearch(nums, target, True)
        
        if head_idx == len(nums) or nums[head_idx] != target:
            return [-1,-1]
        
        return [head_idx, self.binarySearch(nums,target,False)-1]
```

## Note:
The time complexity is
O(log10 (n))

Because binary search cuts the search space roughly in half on each iteration, there can be at most ⌈log10 (n)⌉ iterations. Binary search is invoked twice, so the overall complexity is logarithmic.
